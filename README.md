This is a website Landing page created by pure CSS.

What I have learned so far by building this project :

1- Using 'Normalizing_CSS' to bypass the browser default styles.

2- Basic , Relational and Pseudo selectors.

3- Colors , borders , shadows , gradiants and inheritance.

4- Layouts including : Floating , Flexbox and Grid.

5- Media Queries for screen sizing styles.

6- Typography.

7- Images.

8- Forms.

9- Transformation , Transition and Animation.

10 - Using BEM and variables to write clean CSS.

This is by far the most thing I could accomplish using pure CSS.
